# Tic Tac Toe

This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game.

## How to Play

-   Two players take turns placing their marks ("X" or "O") on a 3x3 grid.
-   The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
-   If the board fills up without a winner, it's a draw.
